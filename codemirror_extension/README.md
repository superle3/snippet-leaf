# codemirror-latex-suite

A port of [obsidian-latex-suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite) exposing only the CodeMirror 6 extensions. As of right now, this package only supports LaTeX documents and not markdown documents like the original port.
The following features have been ported over:

- Snippet engine. Automatic text expansion makes writing commands much easier. Instead of having to reach for `\`, you can just type `alpha` or `cup`.
- Autofraction. Just use `/` to create a `\frac{$0}{$1}` instead of writing the whole `\frac` out.
- Matrix shortcuts. In math environments such as `align, gather, matrix, etc`, `Enter` -> `\\ \n` (creating a new row), `Tab` -> `&` (creating a new column) and `Shift-Enter` exits the environment.
- Tabout: Use tab to get out of enclosing `(),{},[],\(\),\[\],$$,$$$$`.
- Concealment, change the appearance of `alpha` to Î± and more.
- Highlighting and coloring brackets: use different colors to differentiate between brackets easier and highlight the brackets the cursor is currently in.

For more details, you can read the [readme](https://github.com/superle3/snippet-leaf/blob/main/README.md) of snippetleaf, the browser extension for overleaf.
