## 0.0.1 (2025-08-26)

Initial Release

A self-signed extension file will be provided. The extension
will (hopefully) be uploaded later on AMO and the chrome extension store.

### New features

- Snippet engine
    - snippet config in typescript
    - Auto-fraction
    - Math context adjusted for latex
    - Snippet variables in json5
- Keymaps:
    - Matrix shortcuts
    - Tabout
- Highlighting and colorizing brackets
- Concealment of math equations with possible delayed reveal
- Settings
    - TypeScript (es2015) instead of javascript and custom hovertooltip for
      jsdoc documentation.

### Breaking changes

- Snippet syntax changed from `$X`, `${X:placeholder}`, `[[X]]`, to `@X`, `@{X}`, `@{X:placeholder}` and `@[X]`. Where you can now escape `@` with `@@`, so you can still use all characters.

### Removed

- Math preview (not currently possible for Overleaf, therefor omitted)
